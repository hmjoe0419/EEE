Security analysis on pmuBage data:

The pmuBAGE dataset is a synthetic, high-dimensional dataset designed for studying phasor measurement unit (PMU) events, focusing on frequency and voltage anomalies. It includes 84 frequency and 620 voltage events organized in tensors containing real power,
reactive power, voltage magnitude, and frequency measurements over 600 time steps at 30 Hz. This structured dataset provides a rich foundation for investigating complex temporal and spatial patterns associated with power system dynamics.
In this paper, we aim to develop and integrate  a resilient Intrusion Detection System (IDS) tailored for cybersecurity analysis in critical power systems by exploring advanced techniques to identify, mitigate, and prevent cyberattacks such as
false data injection, replay attacks, and denial-of-service disruptions. The pmuBAGE dataset is a tool for advancing the security and reliability of smart grids and power infrastructures by combining state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms 
with privacy-preserving methodologies.
